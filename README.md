# DropZone - Mod for Company of Heroes 2

DropZone is a mod that provides a new game mode and game mechanics to the game called Company of Heroes 2.  The mod can be downloaded from Steam: [DropZone 1.6](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=356017805)

**Note**: Originally, this project wasn't open source. Moved here later.

## Motivation

The idea was to code a mod that changes the feeling of the game and brings some new features. The mod was released on Steam in late 2014. The mod has been updated a couple of times after the release. 

Nowadays, over 30 000 users have downloaded the mod. After two and half years after the release, the mod still has occasionally some users. 


## Description

When Dropzone mod is selected, every few minutes airplanes will drop a few paradrops in the middle of the map. The paradrops might contains equipment, team weapons, upgrades or even vehicles. Players will also have extra abilities like smoke bombs that help them to capture the current dropzone.
